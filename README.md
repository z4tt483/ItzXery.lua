- **Customizable ESP Colors:** Users can set highlight colors according to their preference.

- Can be used alongside other performance optimization scripts like AntiLag2025.  
- Does not interfere with normal player interaction.

## 3. Usage Recommendations

- Run **AntiLag2025** first to maximize FPS and visual stability.  
- Run **ESP-Players** afterward to highlight other players without reducing performance.  
- Enable FPS Boost & Ultra Lighting when playing on large servers or heavy maps.  
- Use the *Skip Loading* button to instantly activate GUI & controls during the splash screen.  
- Avoid enabling part effects that may conflict with game mechanics.

## 4. Best Practices & Ethics

- Use scripts for **development, testing, or personal use**.  
- Avoid usage that harms other players or violates Terms of Service.  
- Scripts are tested on executors supporting `HttpGet` & `loadstring`. Behavior may differ on restricted executors.  
- Always consider device performance before enabling all features at once.

## 7. Loadstring / How to Run the Scripts

Use the following snippet to run both scripts directly on Roblox executors:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z4tt483/ItzXery.lua/main/auto-activate-Antilag%26Esp-Players.lua"))()
